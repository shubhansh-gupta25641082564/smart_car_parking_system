## Smart Car Parking System

### Project Overview

The Smart Car Parking System is an innovative IoT project designed to revolutionize the parking experience. This system integrates advanced features such as a smart billing system, a smart car slot counter, and autonomous barriers for entry and exit, all managed through an intuitive app or website. The system ensures efficient parking management and provides real-time monitoring capabilities for both users and parking authorities.

### Features

1. *Smart Billing System*: The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of the car's stay in each slot. Each slot is equipped with an individual IR sensor to accurately track the time a car spends in the slot, ensuring precise billing.
2. *Smart Car Slot Counter*: IR sensors are used to monitor the occupancy of each parking slot. The data collected is displayed on an LCD, providing real-time information on available slots.
3. *Autonomous Barriers for Entry and Exit*: The system employs servo motors to control barriers, allowing automated entry and exit based on slot availability and billing status.
4. *Real-Time Monitoring*: Users and parking authorities can continuously monitor the status of cars and their stay times via an app or website, ensuring transparency and ease of management.

### Components

- *Arduino Uno R3*: The central microcontroller that manages the entire system.
- *IR Sensors*: Used for detecting car presence at the barriers and in individual slots.
- *Servo Motors*: Operate the barriers for automated entry and exit.
- *LCD Display*: Shows real-time slot availability and other relevant information.
- *Jumper Wires & Breadboard*: Used for making connections between the components.
- *Arduino IDE*: The integrated development environment used for programming the Arduino.

### Detailed Description

The Smart Car Parking System begins with the Arduino Uno R3, which serves as the brain of the project. Upon a car's arrival, IR sensors at the entry barrier detect the car and signal the Arduino to activate the servo motor, lifting the barrier and allowing the car to enter. Each parking slot is equipped with an individual IR sensor that detects the presence of a car and logs the time of entry. 

This data is continuously sent to the Arduino, which updates the smart billing system. The duration of the carâ€™s stay is calculated, and the corresponding fee is determined. This information is displayed on an LCD for easy viewing.

When a car leaves, the exit barrier IR sensor detects the car, and the Arduino instructs the servo motor to lift the exit barrier. The system then logs the exit time, calculates the total bill, and updates the slot's availability status on the LCD.

Users can monitor the status of the parking lot in real-time through a dedicated app or website. The app provides information on slot availability, the duration of the stay for each car, and the current bill amount, ensuring users have complete visibility.

Parking authorities can also use the app or website to manage the parking lot efficiently, track cars, and ensure proper billing. This real-time monitoring capability enhances the user experience and streamlines parking management.

#### How It Works

1. *Vehicle Detection*: When a vehicle approaches the parking entry, an IR sensor detects its presence. The system then checks the availability of parking slots.
2. *Barrier Control*: If a slot is available, the servo motor opens the entry barrier to allow the vehicle to enter. The LCD displays the number of available slots, which updates in real-time.
3. *Slot Counting*: The system continuously monitors the parking slots. When a vehicle enters, the available slot count decreases, and when a vehicle exits, the count increases.
4. *Smart Billing*: The system tracks the time a vehicle spends in the parking area. Upon exit, the smart billing system calculates the total fee based on the duration and displays it on the LCD. The exit barrier opens automatically after the payment process.
5. *Real Time Monitoring*: Users can monitor the status of the parking lot in real-time through a dedicated app or website. The app provides information on slot availability, the duration of the stay for each car, and the current bill amount, ensuring users have complete visibility. Parking authorities can also use the app or website to manage the parking lot efficiently, track cars, and ensure proper billing. This real-time monitoring capability enhances the user experience and streamlines parking management.

### Conclusion

The Smart Car Parking System leverages IoT technology to offer a seamless and efficient parking experience. With features like smart billing, real-time slot counting, and autonomous barriers, this system provides a comprehensive solution for modern parking challenges.
